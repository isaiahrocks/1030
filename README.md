# 1030
This program is a simple program I wrote in an introductory class. It takes a command line string and reverses it.
OR if there are more than 3 command line arguments, it makes a long string out of all the arguments in the command line

compile with:

gcc -o runMe lab13.c

run with: ./runMe reverse string
or ./runMe arg1 arg2 arg3 (...)
